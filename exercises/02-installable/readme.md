# Exercise 2 - Installable Web Application

In this exercise, you'll add a web app manifest file and some JavaScript code to a web application to make it installable. 

**Note:** You can add the manifest to an existing web application of your own, a sample web app from the Internet, or you can use the one provided with the course materials.

## Using the Sample App Included with the Course

To use the source project included with the student files, clone this GitHub repository to your local development system by opening a terminal window or command prompt and executing the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/johnwargo/pwa-starter-course
```

In the cloned repo, the sample application used for this exercise is in a folder called `exercises/02-installable/tip-calculator-start`, make a copy of that folder and work in the copy for this exercise.

If you run into trouble, the completed exercise is in the repo's `exercises/02-installable/tip-calculator-end` folder.
